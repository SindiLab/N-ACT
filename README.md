#### Step 1: Install Requirements Explicitly

Ensure that you are in the same directory as `requirements.txt`. Then using `pip`, we can install the requirements with:

````bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````
Although the core requirements are listed directly in `setup.py`, it is good to run this beforehand in case of any dependecy on packages from GitHub. 

#### Step 2: Install Package Locally
Make sure to be in the same directory as `setup.py`. Then, using `pip`, run:

````bash
pip install -e .
````
